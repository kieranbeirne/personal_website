          <h2>Who am I?</h2> 
          <p style="color:white;font-size: x-large;"> My name is Kieran Beirne and I chose to take CSCE 445 this semester because I am interested in the way that media evolves over time and how it impacts our personal lives, interactions and recreation. I enjoy reading, history and technology, and this class seems to combine the three. I hope to gain a greater understanding into how media shapes our entertainment, education, and recreation, and also the direction that this ever changing area of study is heading.

          <h2>Television</h2> 
          <p style="color:white;font-size: x-large;"> On most days, I will watch one or two 30 minute episode of TV per day, usually at dinner with my roommates. My favorite genres of TV shows are comedies, live sports, sci-fis and documentaries. Some of the TV shows I watch are The Simpsons, The Mandalorian, Game of Thrones and Breaking Bad. The sports I like watching are football, soccer and formula one racing.

          <h2>Video Games</h2> 
          <p style="color:white;font-size: x-large;"> I like to play video games on the weekends or when I have free time. I like racing, action and adventure games. Some of my favorite video games are Mario Kart, Halo, Minecraft and Rocket League. I play video games on my Nintendo Switch, my Xbox One and my PC that I built. I use video games as a way to keep in touch with friends and family who live in different cities, states and even countries.

          <h2>Movies</h2> 
          <p style="color:white;font-size: x-large;"> I normally watch one or two movies per week, usually while doing homework or on the weekend. My favorite genres of movies are comedies, science fiction, action and thrillers. I prefer watching older movies but will occasionally watch a new movie in a theater. Some of my favorite movies are Alien, Cars, Ratatouille, Borat, Bladerunner (1982) and Office Space.
