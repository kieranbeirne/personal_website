          <h2>Who am I?</h2> 
          <p style="color:white;font-size: x-large;"> My name is Kieran Beirne and I am a computer science student at Texas A&M, graduating in May 2024. I am graduating with an emphasis in psychology which I hope to use for creating accessible and inclusive software. I have interests in software engineering and DevOps and I am currently pursuing a software engineering internship for Summer 2023. I graduated from Southlake Carroll High in 2020, where I was a <a style="color: white" href = "https://mysouthlakenews.com/2019/11/sports/postseason-honors-roll-in-for-state-champion-cross-country-teams">varsity cross country runner,</a> which culminated in a state championship my senior year. My hobbies and interets include running, coffee, skydiving and movies. In college, I have taken leadership roles for two clubs, Memorial Student Center Freshmen in Service and Hosting (MSC FISH) and the Student Engineers' Council (SEC).

          <h2>Memorial Student Center Freshmen in Service and Hosting</h2> 
          <p style="color:white;font-size: x-large;"> <a style="color: white" href = "https://fish.tamu.edu">MSC FISH</a> is a service organization that provides leadership opportunities aimed at enhancing its members' purpose and identity by engaging in community service and program development on campus and within the community. I served as the Leadership and Diversity Director of MSC FISH from 2021-2022. I curated and presented internal workshops over topics such as implicit bias, privilege and culture to all 90 members of MSC FISH. I mentored 8 freshmen over the course of the year and we all still keep in touch today. Being in MSC FISH was a fantastic way to give back to the community and develop close friendships in college. I highly encourage all A&M students to get involved in Freshman Leadership Organizations (FLOs).
